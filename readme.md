## Current Issue
In-game user input does not text wrap until container div is full. Was working on `justify()` to calculate the next work length of `terrain` to decide if div should be created in new line.

## Known Issues
1.  @Safari: Player input does not show up but competitors' does. Empty character divs are appended to `#myTrack` instead.

## Good to have Features
* Blinking Cursor:
*  Replaced with `|` for the time being
